# Go-projects  


This is my GitHub repo of all the practice projects just coded for fun in Golang.  


1) GoContact ( just did to get a good understanding of Go concepts like mutextes and go routines and setting up HTTP servers)
   
 Project Goal:
   
Building a small HTTP API server in Go that:  


Accepts form submissions (via JSON).  


Processes each one concurrently with goroutines and channels.  


Stores all submissions in memory using a slice.  


Lets you view them later via a GET endpoint.
